      <description>Recursive Function  A function that calls itself Solves problems by solving smaller instances of the same problem until the problem is so small it can be solved directly (also see Recursive Function )  Russian Doll A russian doll is a good example of recursion, as it gets smaller and smaller until there exists a doll that is too small to contain another doll
Parts to a Recursive Function  A simply case: can be solved directly A complex case: can be made simpler (and simpler &amp;hellip; until it looks like the simple case)  Factorial Find the factorial of n using recursion</description>

      <description>Prerequisites: Machine Learning Terminology Semantic Gap In order to train a Machine Learning Model that can classify images, we need to first overcome a few challenges, commonly known as the Semantic Gap When the computer is given an image, it reads the data as a 3d-matrix/array defined by its dimensions and RGB pixels. A typical matrix size would be [800, 600, 3], with the 800 and 600 being dimensions and the 3 representing the 3 RGB (red, green blue) channels.</description>

      <description>Labels  A label is the thing we&amp;rsquo;re predicting ex: email is spam or not spam  Features  A feature is an input variable. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features spam detector ex:  words in email text sender&amp;rsquo;s address time of email email contains the phrase &amp;ldquo;one weird trick&amp;rdquo;    Examples  An example is a particular instance of data.</description>

      <title>Intro to Sorting Algorithms</title>

      <description>We use sorting algorithms to keep an array in order. Here is a list of common sorting algorithms. Beware: the first three are highly inefficient! (See Time Complexity )
Bubble Sort: $O(n^2)$  Set the first element as the current element. swap(current, next) if current &amp;gt; next, essentially moving it down the list Repeat last step.  if current &amp;lt; next: set next as the current element if current = end of list: set the first element as the current element   The array is sorted when no swaps occur in a single pass (from first to last).</description>

      <description>In computer science, analysis of algorithms is a very crucial part. It is important to find the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem. It is possible to have many algorithms to solve a problem, but the challenge here is to choose the most efficient one.
  Now the point is, how can we recognize the most efficient algorithm if we have a set of different algorithms? Here, the concept of space and time complexity of algorithms comes into existence.</description>

      <description>What is Brute Forcing? A brute-force problem is exactly what it sounds like: simply doing everything possible to eventually reach the answer. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you were trying to achieve the password to someone&amp;rsquo;s phone (assume 4 digits from 0 to 9). A brute force solution would be to try every single password possible. This way, it is guaranteed that at one point, the answer would be correct.  Pros  Easy/Uncomplicated Guarantees a solution   Cons  Inefficient Not suitable for every problem    Brute Force in the USACO  It is almost guaranteed that there will be at least one brute force problem in a USACO Bronze contest, and sometimes there will be 2 (and rarely 3).</description>

      <description>Java Syntax Files All Java files &amp;amp; programs have the .java ending. ex: HelloWorld.java
Comments Comments are used to help understand a piece of code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are human-readable words intended to make the code more readable.
// this is an example comment /* this is a multilineexample comment */ Brackets and Semicolons Java uses braces { } to define blocks of code.</description>
