      <description>What is Brute Forcing? A brute-force problem is exactly what it sounds like: simply doing everything possible to eventually reach the answer. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you were trying to achieve the password to someone&amp;rsquo;s phone (assume 4 digits from 0 to 9). A brute force solution would be to try every single password possible.
