      <description>Node.js What is Node.js Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome&amp;rsquo;s V8 JavaScript engine. You can use Node.js to create applications, programs, backend projects, server-side stuff and much more &amp;hellip;
Node is also quite popular, and easy to use/learn.
Installing Node.js To install Node.js, navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and choose the correct installer for your OS System.
Follow the steps (choose the defaults if you&amp;rsquo;re unsure) to install Node.
After installation, open a Command Prompt or Powershell or Terminal and try running node --version to check if Node.</description>

      <description>What is JavaScript &amp;hellip; Objects Almost everything in JavaScript is an Object. Objects can be defined as variables.
A simple example is a String, which is also an Object.
var name = &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;; However, an Object can also contain multiple values. In an Object, you can store properties as well as methods.
var person = {firstName: &amp;quot;Joey&amp;quot;,lastName: &amp;quot;Bobby&amp;quot;,age: 14,state: &amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;} In this person Object above, we have 4 properties stored in the format of property: value</description>

      <description>Linear Search  prerequisites  none   how it works  iterates one at a time from left to right   advantages  simple to implement   example  when searching through a phone book for an entry under W go page-by-page until you reach W   O(n)  Binary Search  prerequisites  the array must be sorted   how it works  start at the middle and check the value if the value is less  check the middle value of the left half   else the value is greater  check the middle value of the right half   repeat until the value is found   advantages  much faster than linear search, especially as n increases   example  when searching through a phone book for an entry under W start at M (middle of A-Z) W &amp;gt; M so check T (middle of M-Z) W &amp;gt; T so check W (middle of T-Z) W = W so we&amp;rsquo;re done   O(log(n)) Check out this article to learn more about Binary Search  Jump Search  prerequisites  the array must be sorted (like Binary Search) traverses the array in &amp;ldquo;jumps&amp;rdquo; of âˆšn (n being the array length)   how it works  once the number being checked is greater than the target number,</description>

      <description>What is CSS CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used by web pages to help keep information in the proper display format. CSS helps beautify HTML and give it life.
Prerequisites: Knowledge in HTML, check out our article on HTML here CSS Syntax 
In this image, h1 is the selector and then there are 2 declarations
 color: blue; font-size: 12px;  This sets the font-color to blue and then the font-size to 12px for all h1 tags</description>

      <description>Recursive Function  A function that calls itself Solves problems by solving smaller instances of the same problem until the problem is so small it can be solved directly (also see Recursive Function )  Russian Doll A russian doll is a good example of recursion, as it gets smaller and smaller until there exists a doll that is too small to contain another doll
Parts to a Recursive Function  A simply case: can be solved directly A complex case: can be made simpler (and simpler &amp;hellip; until it looks like the simple case)  Factorial Find the factorial of n using recursion</description>

      <description>Prerequisites: Machine Learning Terminology Semantic Gap In order to train a Machine Learning Model that can classify images, we need to first overcome a few challenges, commonly known as the Semantic Gap When the computer is given an image, it reads the data as a 3d-matrix/array defined by its dimensions and RGB pixels. A typical matrix size would be [800, 600, 3], with the 800 and 600 being dimensions and the 3 representing the 3 RGB (red, green blue) channels.</description>

      <description>Labels  A label is the thing we&amp;rsquo;re predicting ex: email is spam or not spam  Features  A feature is an input variable. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features spam detector ex:  words in email text sender&amp;rsquo;s address time of email email contains the phrase &amp;ldquo;one weird trick&amp;rdquo;    Examples  An example is a particular instance of data.</description>

      <description>We use sorting algorithms to keep an array in order. Here is a list of common sorting algorithms. Beware: the first three are highly inefficient! (See Time Complexity )
Bubble Sort: $O(n^2)$  Set the first element as the current element. swap(current, next) if current &amp;gt; next, essentially moving it down the list Repeat last step.  if current &amp;lt; next: set next as the current element if current = end of list: set the first element as the current element   The array is sorted when no swaps occur in a single pass (from first to last).</description>

      <description>In computer science, analysis of algorithms is a very crucial part. It is important to find the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem. It is possible to have many algorithms to solve a problem, but the challenge here is to choose the most efficient one.
  Now the point is, how can we recognize the most efficient algorithm if we have a set of different algorithms? Here, the concept of space and time complexity of algorithms comes into existence.</description>

      <description>What is Brute Forcing? A brute-force problem is exactly what it sounds like: simply doing everything possible to eventually reach the answer. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you were trying to achieve the password to someone&amp;rsquo;s phone (assume 4 digits from 0 to 9). A brute force solution would be to try every single password possible. This way, it is guaranteed that at one point, the answer would be correct.  Pros  Easy/Uncomplicated Guarantees a solution   Cons  Inefficient Not suitable for every problem    Brute Force in the USACO  It is almost guaranteed that there will be at least one brute force problem in a USACO Bronze contest, and sometimes there will be 2 (and rarely 3).</description>

      <description>Java Syntax Files All Java files &amp;amp; programs have the .java ending. ex: HelloWorld.java
Comments Comments are used to help understand a piece of code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are human-readable words intended to make the code more readable.
// this is an example comment /* this is a multilineexample comment */ Brackets and Semicolons Java uses braces { } to define blocks of code.</description>

Comments Comments are used to help understand a piece of code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are human-readable words intended to make the code more readable.
# this is an example comment Indentation &amp;amp; Colons While most programming languages use brackets { } to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation and colons : instead.</description>
